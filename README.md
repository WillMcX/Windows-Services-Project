# Windows-Services-Project
- Independent Study project on the Windows Services and the Vulnerabilities that can be exploited within them.
- W.I.P - Making a service extension / application that scans all currently running processs on the system on an interval and then after that will gather differences and check for potentially risky services running on the computer and notify the user
# Week 2 Delivery:
- Research and provide info on signed files, verified v unverified publishers, criteria for verification
- Research the different types of services (e.g active, win32, etc)
- Low level definition of what a driver is, does?
- Try and figure out how I can scrape and create one single entry for every unique process running on the system.
